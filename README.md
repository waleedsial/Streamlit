# Streamlit
Machine Learning Web Applications
This repo contains a web application which is created using stream lit. 
To use the code, you need to install stream lit library & use the command streamlit run appname.py
The application is deployed on AWS Ec2 instance & can be accessed at http://50.18.81.10:8502/ 
I have followed a link for AWS deployment & shared the details in the AWS deployment guide.
